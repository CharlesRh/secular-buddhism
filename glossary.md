## Core Terms from the Eightfold Path

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Samma Ditthi** | Right View - understanding reality clearly, particularly the Four Noble Truths. The first factor of the Eightfold Path. |
| **dukkha** | Often translated as "suffering," but encompasses a broader range of experiences including stress, dissatisfaction, and the sense that something is always a bit off in our lives. One of the Three Marks of Existence and the subject of the First Noble Truth. |
| **tanha** | Craving or thirst - identified as the primary cause of dukkha in the Second Noble Truth. Takes three forms: craving for sensory pleasures, craving for existence, and craving for non-existence. |
| **Majjhima Patipada** | The Middle Way - the path between extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification discovered by the Buddha as the route to liberation. |

## Impermanence and Causality

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **anicca** | Impermanence - the truth that all conditioned phenomena are in constant flux and subject to change. One of the Three Marks of Existence. |
| **paticca-samuppada** | Dependent origination - the principle that all phenomena arise in dependence upon multiple causes and conditions, with nothing existing in isolation. |
| **karma** (Pali: **kamma**) | Action - the principle that our intentional actions have consequences. In Buddhism, karma refers to volitional actions that bring about certain results based on natural law rather than divine judgment. |
