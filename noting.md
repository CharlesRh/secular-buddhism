# Noting Practice Cheat Sheet

## What Is Noting?
A mindfulness technique where you gently label experiences as they arise. Instead of getting lost in thoughts or emotions, you simply recognize and name what's happening. This creates space between you and your experience.

## The Simple Flow Chart
```
START HERE ↓

1. THINKING or FEELING?
   ├── THINKING (mental activity)
   └── FEELING (sensations, emotions)

2. What's the tone?
   ├── Pleasant
   ├── Unpleasant  
   └── Neutral

3. If very strong, be specific:
   ├── Planning, Remembering, Judging
   ├── Body sensations, Emotions
   └── Five Hindrances (advanced)
```

## How to Note
1. Gently whisper the label mentally
2. Note what's obvious (don't hunt)
3. Return to breath
4. Repeat when mind wanders

## Basic Examples
- "Thinking" (mental activity of any kind)
- "Feeling" (physical sensations or emotions)
- "Pleasant" (attractive quality of experience)
- "Unpleasant" (aversive quality of experience)
- "Neutral" (neither attractive nor aversive)

## Feeling Tone Examples
- "Pleasant thinking" (planning vacation, remembering success)
- "Unpleasant feeling" (back pain, stomach tension)
- "Neutral thinking" (mental grocery list, routine planning)
- "Pleasant feeling" (warm sunlight, taste of food)
- "Unpleasant thinking" (worry, self-criticism)

## The Five Hindrances (Advanced)
- **Wanting** - craving, desire
- **Aversion** - resistance, anger
- **Restlessness** - worry, agitation
- **Dullness** - mental fog, sleepiness  
- **Doubt** - uncertainty, second-guessing

## Working with Feeling Tones
Feeling tones are the pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral quality that colors every experience. They're what drive most of our reactive patterns:

- **Pleasant** → we want more → craving → clinging → suffering when we can't control it
- **Unpleasant** → we want it gone → aversion → resistance → suffering multiplied
- **Neutral** → often ignored → missed opportunities for presence and contentment

**Practice**: Catch feeling tones before they trigger the full reactive chain. Simply note "pleasant," "unpleasant," or "neutral" and return to your meditation object.

## Common Mistakes
- Over-noting everything (creates busyness)
- Worrying about perfect labels
- Analyzing instead of just noting
- Missing the feeling tone that drives reactions

## Why It Works
Noting creates crucial space between you and your experience—instead of "I AM angry," it becomes "anger is present." This breaks automatic reactivity by interrupting the spell of being completely lost in thoughts or emotions. 

**With feeling tones specifically**: You catch the reactive process at its very beginning—before pleasant experiences trigger craving or unpleasant ones trigger aversion. This prevents the chain reaction that leads to suffering.

Over time, you develop an "observer self" that can witness all mental states, while directly seeing how everything arises and passes away naturally.

## The Goal
Not perfect labeling, but **clear seeing** and freedom from being hijacked by thoughts, emotions, and reactive patterns.

## Long-Term Benefits

With consistent practice over months and years, noting becomes **effortless and automatic**, running subtly in the background of awareness. You develop **genuine emotional freedom**—feelings still arise but don't overwhelm or control you anymore. **Mental clarity** increases as you spend less time lost in stories and more time present with actual reality. This naturally leads to **equanimity**, where you respond to both pleasant and unpleasant experiences with greater balance and wisdom, eventually culminating in **deep insights** into the impermanent nature of all experience and the true nature of self. Most practically, **reactive patterns dissolve** as you consistently catch them at the feeling tone level before they gain momentum.
